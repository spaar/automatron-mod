The Automatron
==============
The Automatron is a block you can use to automate processes in your machine. It can activate blocks or change their settings, on a set schedule, with a single key press.

Configuring an Automatron
=========================
The basic principle is that each Automatron has a number of _actions_ which it activates when it is activated itself.
You can configure an Automatron using the normal block mapper menu. There, you can set a key which activates it and open the configuration window.
A click on the "Configure" button will open the configuration window. It consists of a list of actions, an "Add Action" button and a "Close" button.
Note that opening the configuration window will also close the block mapper and temporarily deactivate the block mapper tool.
When you close the configuration window using the "Close" button, the block mapper will be reopened and the block mapper tool reactivated.

Adding Actions
--------------
After pressing "Add Action", the Add Action menu will open. It lists the available action types as buttons.
A click on one of them will add an action of the corresponding type and open its configuration screen.

The available types and their options are as follows:

- Change Toggle Value  
  Description: Changes the value of a toggle button of a block when activated.  
  Options:
    - Block: The block whose toggle you want to change. Use the "Select Block" button to select one, as described in the section "Selecting Blocks".
	- Toggle: Which toggle of the block you want to change. There will be one button for each available toggle, the order is the same as in the block mapper.
	- Mode: In Toggle mode, the value of the toggle is always set to the opposite of what it is currently.
	        In Set mode, the the toggle is set to a specified value, regardless of what value it currently has.
